## 1. Ubuntu tracker issue
I recently installed ubuntu 20.04 and htop showed me that there is the tracker thing taking up 100% of my cpu. Below are my finding:

`tracker reset --hard`will resolve the issue, but when restart, I have the same problem again. I did found another thread of a similar issue, but I haven't tested that yet.

**Below haven't tested**

So there was problem with the tracker extract, and the suggested walk around is to disable it, see [Reference1][reference1]
```
$ tracker daemon -t
$ cd ~/.config/autostart
$ cp -v /etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-*.desktop ./
$ for FILE in tracker-*.desktop; do echo Hidden=true >> $FILE; done
$ rm -rf ~/.cache/tracker ~/.local/share/tracker

```

However, it looks like that they have fixed this issue 4 months ago, see [Reference2][reference2]. I wasn't sure if the merge has been released or not.
